Adversaries may acquire malware to support their operations, obtaining a means for maintaining control of remote machines, evading defenses, and executing post-compromise behaviors.</p><p>In addition to downloading free malware from the internet, adversaries may purchase these capabilities from third-party entities. Third-party entities can include technology companies that specialize in malware development, criminal marketplaces (including Malware-as-a-Service, or MaaS), or from individuals. In addition to purchasing malware, adversaries may steal and repurpose malware from third-party entities (including other adversaries).</p>\n\n                                    </div>\n                            </div>\n                            <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n                                <div class=\"card\">\n                                    <div class=\"card-body\">\n                                            <div class=\"row card-data\" id=\"card-id\">\n                                                <div class=\"col-md-1 px-0 text-center\"></div>\n                                                <div class=\"col-md-11 pl-0\">\n                                                    <span class=\"h5 card-title\">ID:&nbsp;</span>T1588.001\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        <!--stop-indexing-for-search-->\n                                        <div class=\"row card-data\">\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-1 px-0 text-center\"></div>\n                                            <div class=\"col-md-11 pl-0\">\n                                                    <span class=\"h5 card-title\">Sub-technique of:&nbsp;</span>\n                                                    <a href=\"/techniques/T1588\">T1588</a>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                        <!--start-indexing-for-search-->\n                                            <div id=\"card-tactics\" class=\"row card-data\">\n                                                <div class=\"col-md-1 px-0 text-center\">\n                                                    <span data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"left\" title=\"\" data-test-ignore=\"true\" data-original-title=\"The tactic objectives that the (sub-)technique can be used to accomplish\">\u24d8</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"col-md-11 pl-0\">\n                                                    <span class=\"h5 card-title\">Tactic:</span>\n                                                        <a href=\"/tactics/TA0042\">Resource Development</a>                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                            <div class=\"row card-data\">\n                                                <div class=\"col-md-1 px-0 text-center\">\n                                                    <span data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"left\" title=\"\" data-test-ignore=\"true\" data-original-title=\"The system an adversary is operating within;
