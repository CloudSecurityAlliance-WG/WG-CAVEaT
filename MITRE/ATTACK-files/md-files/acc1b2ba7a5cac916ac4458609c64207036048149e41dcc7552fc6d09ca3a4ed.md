compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount
and sensitivity of data available to external parties.
Detection
Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the
visibility of the target organization, making detection diﬃcult for defenders.
Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.Adversaries may gather the victim's physical location(s) that can be used during targeting. Information about physical locations of a target
organization may include a variety of details, including where key resources and infrastructure are housed. Physical locations may also
indicate what legal jurisdiction and/or authorities the victim operates within.
Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via Phishing for Information. Physical locations of a
target organization may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: Search Victim-Owned Websites or Social
Media). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Phishing for Information or Search
Open Websites/Domains), establishing operational resources (ex: Develop Capabilities or Obtain Capabilities), and/or initial access (ex:
Phishing or Hardware Additions).Other sub-techniques of Gather Victim Org Information (4)
