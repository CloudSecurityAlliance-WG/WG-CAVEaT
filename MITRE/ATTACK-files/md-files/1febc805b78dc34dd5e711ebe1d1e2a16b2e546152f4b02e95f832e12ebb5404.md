G1017 Volt Typhoon Volt Typhoon has used compromised PRTG servers from other organizations for C2.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.Adversaries may compromise third-party servers that can be used during targeting. Use of servers allows an adversary to stage, launch, and
execute an operation. During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize servers for various tasks, including for Command and
Control. Instead of purchasing a Server or Virtual Private Server, adversaries may compromise third-party servers in support of operations.
Adversaries may also compromise web servers to support watering hole operations, as in Drive-by Compromise, or email servers to support
Phishing operations.Other sub-techniques of Compromise Infrastructure (7)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0035 Internet Scan Response
ContentOnce adversaries have provisioned software on a compromised server (ex: for use as a
command and control server), internet scans may reveal servers that adversaries have
compromised. Consider looking for identiﬁable patterns such as services listening,
certiﬁcates in use, SSL/TLS negotiation features, or other response artifacts associated
with adversary C2 software.
Response
MetadataMuch of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making
detection of this behavior diﬃcult. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of
the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control.
