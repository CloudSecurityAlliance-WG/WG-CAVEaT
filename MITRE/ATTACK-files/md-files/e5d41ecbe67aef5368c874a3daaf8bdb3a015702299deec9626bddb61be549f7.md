Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0087 APT39 APT39 has utilized tools to capture mouse movements.
S0631 Chaes Chaes has a module to perform any API hooking it desires.
S0381 FlawedAmmyy FlawedAmmyy can collect mouse events.
S0641 Kobalos Kobalos has used a compromised SSH client to capture the hostname, port, username and password used
to establish an SSH connection from the compromised host.
S1060 Mafalda Mafalda can conduct mouse event logging.
S1059 metaMain metaMain can log mouse events.
Mitigations
This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.Adversaries may use methods of capturing user input to obtain credentials or collect information. During normal system usage, users often
provide credentials to various different locations, such as login pages/portals or system dialog boxes. Input capture mechanisms may be
transparent to the user (e.g. Credential API Hooking) or rely on deceiving the user into providing input into what they believe to be a genuine
service (e.g. Web Portal Capture).Sub-techniques (4)
