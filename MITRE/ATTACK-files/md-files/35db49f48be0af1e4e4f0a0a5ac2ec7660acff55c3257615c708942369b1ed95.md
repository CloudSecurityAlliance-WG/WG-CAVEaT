Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0125 Remsec Remsec harvests plain-text credentials as a password ﬁlter registered on domain controllers.
G0041 Strider Strider has registered its persistence module on domain controllers as a Windows LSA (Local System Authority)
password ﬁlter to acquire credentials any time a domain, local user, or administrator logs in or changes a
password.

ID Mitigation Description
M1028 Operating
System
ConﬁgurationEnsure only valid password ﬁlters are registered. Filter DLLs must be present in Windows installation
directory (C:\Windows\System32\ by default) of a domain controller and/or local computer with a
corresponding entry in HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Notiﬁcation
Packages.Adversaries may register malicious password ﬁlter dynamic link libraries (DLLs) into the authentication process to acquire user credentials
as they are validated.
Windows password ﬁlters are password policy enforcement mechanisms for both domain and local accounts. Filters are implemented as
DLLs containing a method to validate potential passwords against password policies. Filter DLLs can be positioned on local computers for
local accounts and/or domain controllers for domain accounts. Before registering new passwords in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM),
the Local Security Authority (LSA) requests validation from each registered ﬁlter. Any potential changes cannot take effect until every
registered ﬁlter acknowledges validation.
Adversaries can register malicious password ﬁlters to harvest credentials from local computers and/or entire domains. To perform proper
validation, ﬁlters must receive plain-text credentials from the LSA. A malicious password ﬁlter would receive these plain-text credentials every
time a password request is made.Other sub-techniques of Modify Authentication Process (8)
