https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/004/ 3/6OS Credential Dumping: LSA Secrets
Adversaries with SYSTEM access to a host may attempt to access Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets, which can contain a variety of
different credential materials, such as credentials for service accounts. LSA secrets are stored in the registry at
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets . LSA secrets can also be dumped from memory.
Reg can be used to extract from the Registry. Mimikatz can be used to extract secrets from memory.Other sub-techniques of OS Credential Dumping (8)

ID Name Description
S0677 AADInternals AADInternals can dump secrets from the Local Security Authority.
G0016 APT29 APT29 has used the reg save command to extract LSA secrets oﬄine.
G0064 APT33 APT33 has used a variety of publicly available tools like LaZagne to gather credentials.
S0050 CosmicDuke CosmicDuke collects LSA secrets.
S0488 CrackMapExec CrackMapExec can dump hashed passwords from LSA secrets for the targeted system.
G0035 Dragonﬂy Dragonﬂy has dropped and executed SecretsDump to dump password hashes.
S0008 gsecdump gsecdump can dump LSA secrets.
S1022 IceApple IceApple's Credential Dumper module can dump LSA secrets from registry keys, including:
HKLM\SECURITY\Policy\PolEKList\default , HKLM\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets\\*\CurrVal , and
HKLM\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets\\*\OldVal .
S0357 Impacket SecretsDump and Mimikatz modules within Impacket can perform credential dumping to obtain account
and password information.
G0004 Ke3chang Ke3chang has dumped credentials, including by using gsecdump.
S0349 LaZagne LaZagne can perform credential dumping from LSA secrets to obtain account and password information.
G0077 Leafminer Leafminer used several tools for retrieving login and password information, including LaZagne.
G0045 menuPass menuPass has used a modiﬁed version of pentesting tools wmiexec.vbs and secretsdump.py to dump
credentials.
S0002 Mimikatz Mimikatz performs credential dumping to obtain account and password information useful in gaining
access to additional systems and enterprise network resources. It contains functionality to acquire
information about credentials in many ways, including from the LSA.
G0069 MuddyWater MuddyWater has performed credential dumping with LaZagne.
G0049 OilRig OilRig has used credential dumping tools such as LaZagne to steal credentials to accounts logged into the
compromised system and to Outlook Web Access.
S0192 Pupy Pupy can use Lazagne for harvesting credentials.
G0027 Threat Group-
3390Threat Group-3390 actors have used gsecdump to dump credentials. They have also dumped credentials
from domain controllers.[5]

ID Mitigation Description
M1027 Password Policies Ensure that local administrator accounts have complex, unique passwords across all systems on
the network.
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementFollow best practices for design and administration of an enterprise network to limit privileged
account use across administrative tiers.
M1017 User Training Limit credential overlap across accounts and systems by training users and administrators not
to use the same password for multiple accounts.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may access to a host may attempt
to access Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets. Remote access tools may contain
built-in features or incorporate existing tools like Mimikatz. PowerShell scripts also
exist that contain credential dumping functionality, such as PowerSploit's Invoke-
Mimikatz module, which may require additional logging features to be conﬁgured
in the operating system to collect necessary information for analysis.
