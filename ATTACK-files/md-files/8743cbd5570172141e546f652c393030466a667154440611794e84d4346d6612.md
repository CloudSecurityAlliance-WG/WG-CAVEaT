https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/004/ 3/6Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify System Firewall
Adversaries may disable or modify system ﬁrewalls in order to bypass controls limiting network usage. Changes could be disabling the entire mechanism
as well as adding, deleting, or modifying particular rules. This can be done numerous ways depending on the operating system, including via command-
line, editing Windows Registry keys, and Windows Control Panel.
Modifying or disabling a system ﬁrewall may enable adversary C2 communications, lateral movement, and/or data exﬁltration that would otherwise not
be allowed. For example, adversaries may add a new ﬁrewall rule for a well-known protocol (such as RDP) using a non-traditional and potentially less
securitized port (i.e. Non-Standard Port).Other sub-techniques of Impair Defenses (11)

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/004/ 4/6Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0082 APT38 APT38 have created ﬁrewall exemptions on speciﬁc ports, including ports 443, 6443, 8443, and 9443.
S0031 BACKSPACE The "ZR" variant of BACKSPACE will check to see if known host-based ﬁrewalls are installed on the infected systems.
BACKSPACE will attempt to establish a C2 channel, then will examine open windows to identify a pop-up from the
ﬁrewall software and will simulate a mouse-click to allow the connection to proceed.
S0245 BADCALL BADCALL disables the Windows ﬁrewall before binding to a port.
G0008 Carbanak Carbanak may use netsh to add local ﬁrewall rule exceptions.
S0492 CookieMiner CookieMiner has checked for the presence of "Little Snitch", macOS network monitoring and application ﬁrewall
software, stopping and exiting if it is found.
S0687 Cyclops Blink Cyclops Blink can modify the Linux iptables ﬁrewall to enable C2 communication via a stored list of port numbers.
S0334 DarkComet DarkComet can disable Security Center functions like the Windows Firewall.
G0035 Dragonﬂy Dragonﬂy has disabled host-based ﬁrewalls. The group has also globally opened port 3389.
S0531 Grandoreiro Grandoreiro can block the Deibold Warsaw GAS Tecnologia security tool at the ﬁrewall level.
S0132 H1N1 H1N1 kills and disables services for Windows Firewall.
S0246 HARDRAIN HARDRAIN opens the Windows Firewall to modify incoming connections.
S0376 HOPLIGHT HOPLIGHT has modiﬁed the ﬁrewall using netsh.
S0260 InvisiMole InvisiMole has a command to disable routing and the Firewall on the victim’s machine.
S0088 Kasidet Kasidet has the ability to change ﬁrewall settings to allow a plug-in to be downloaded.
G0094 Kimsuky Kimsuky has been observed disabling the system ﬁrewall.
G0032 Lazarus Group Various Lazarus Group malware modiﬁes the Windows ﬁrewall to allow incoming connections or disable it entirely
using netsh. 
G0059 Magic Hound Magic Hound has added the following rule to a victim's Windows ﬁrewall to allow RDP traﬃc - "netsh" advfirewall
firewall add rule name="Terminal Server" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3389 .
G1009 Moses Staff Moses Staff has used batch scripts that can disable the Windows ﬁrewall on speciﬁc remote machines.
S0336 NanoCore NanoCore can modify the victim's ﬁrewall.
S0108 netsh netsh can be used to disable local ﬁrewall settings.
S0385 njRAT njRAT has modiﬁed the Windows ﬁrewall to allow itself to communicate through the ﬁrewall.
C0014 Operation
WocaoDuring Operation Wocao, threat actors used PowerShell to add and delete rules in the Windows ﬁrewall.
S1032 PyDCrypt PyDCrypt has modiﬁed ﬁrewall rules to allow incoming SMB, NetBIOS, and RPC connections using netsh.exe on
remote machines.
S0125 Remsec Remsec can add or remove applications or ports on the Windows ﬁrewall or disable it entirely.
G0106 Rocke Rocke used scripts which killed processes and added ﬁrewall rules to block traﬃc related to other cryptominers.
C0024 SolarWinds
CompromiseDuring the SolarWinds Compromise, APT29 used netsh to conﬁgure ﬁrewall rules that limited certain UDP outbound
packets.
G0139 TeamTNT TeamTNT has disabled iptables .[2]

S0263 TYPEFRAME TYPEFRAME can open the Windows Firewall on the victim’s machine to allow incoming connections.
S0412 ZxShell ZxShell can disable the ﬁrewall by modifying the registry key
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy\StandardProfile .
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Routinely check account role permissions to ensure only expected users and roles have permission to
modify system ﬁrewalls.
M1022 Restrict File and Directory
PermissionsEnsure proper process and ﬁle permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or
modifying ﬁrewall settings.
M1024 Restrict Registry Permissions Ensure proper Registry permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or modifying
ﬁrewall settings.
M1018 User Account Management Ensure proper user permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or modifying ﬁrewall
settings.
Detection
ID Data Source Data ComponentDetects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments associated with disabling or the modiﬁcation of system
ﬁrewalls such as netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="file and printer sharing" new
enable=Yes ,ufw disable , and ufw logging off .
DS0018 Firewall Firewall
DisableMonitor for changes in the status of the system ﬁrewall such as Windows Security Auditing events 5025
(The Windows ﬁrewall service has been stopped) and 5034 (The Windows ﬁrewall driver was stopped).
Firewall Rule
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to ﬁrewall rules that might allow remote communication over protocols such
as SMD and RDP. Modiﬁcation of ﬁrewall rules might also consider opening local ports and services for
different network proﬁles such as public and domain.
DS0024 Windows RegistryWindows
Registry Key
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to windows Registry keys and/or values that adversaries might use to disable
or modify System Firewall settings such as
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy.[36]
