https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/006/ 3/4Unsecured Credentials: Group Policy Preferences
Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0064 APT33 APT33 has used a variety of publicly available tools like Gpppassword to gather credentials.
S0194 PowerSploit PowerSploit contains a collection of Exﬁltration modules that can harvest credentials from Group Policy
Preferences.
S0692 SILENTTRINITY SILENTTRINITY has a module that can extract cached GPP passwords.
G0102 Wizard Spider Wizard Spider has used PowerShell cmdlets Get-GPPPassword and Find-GPOPassword to ﬁnd unsecured
credentials in a compromised network group policy.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1015 Active Directory Conﬁguration Remove vulnerable Group Policy Preferences.
M1047 Audit Search SYSVOL for any existing GGPs that may contain credentials and remove them.
M1051 Update Software Apply patch KB2962486 which prevents credentials from being stored in GPPs.Adversaries may attempt to ﬁnd unsecured credentials in Group Policy Preferences (GPP). GPP are tools that allow administrators to create
domain policies with embedded credentials. These policies allow administrators to set local accounts.
These group policies are stored in SYSVOL on a domain controller. This means that any domain user can view the SYSVOL share and
decrypt the password (using the AES key that has been made public).
The following tools and scripts can be used to gather and decrypt the password ﬁle from Group Policy Preference XML ﬁles:
Metasploit’s post exploitation module: post/windows/gather/credentials/gpp
Get-GPPPassword
gpprefdecrypt.py
On the SYSVOL share, adversaries may use the following command to enumerate potential GPP XML ﬁles: dir /s \* .xmlOther sub-techniques of Unsecured Credentials (8)
