https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004/ 3/6Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell
Adversaries may abuse Unix shell commands and scripts for execution. Unix shells are the primary command prompt on Linux and macOS
systems, though many variations of the Unix shell exist (e.g. sh, bash, zsh, etc.) depending on the speciﬁc OS or distribution. Unix shells
can control every aspect of a system, with certain commands requiring elevated privileges.
Unix shells also support scripts that enable sequential execution of commands as well as other typical programming operations such as
conditionals and loops. Common uses of shell scripts include long or repetitive tasks, or the need to run the same set of commands on
multiple systems.
Adversaries may abuse Unix shells to execute various commands or payloads. Interactive shells may be accessed through command and
control channels or during lateral movement such as with SSH. Adversaries may also leverage shell scripts to deliver and execute multiple
commands on victims or as part of payloads used for persistence.Other sub-techniques of Command and Scripting Interpreter (9)

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1038 Execution Prevention Use application control where appropriate.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may abuse Unix shell commands and
scripts for execution. Unix shell usage may be common on administrator, developer, or power
user systems, depending on job function. If scripting is restricted for normal users, then any
attempt to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are
not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or
other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the ﬁle system
when possible to determine their actions and intent.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may abuse Unix shell commands and scripts for
execution.[38]
