Gather Victim Network Information: Network Topology
Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G1016 FIN13 FIN13 has searched for infrastructure that can provide remote access to an environment for targeting efforts.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount
and sensitivity of data available to external parties.
Detection
Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the
visibility of the target organization, making detection diﬃcult for defenders.
Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.
ReferencesAdversaries may gather information about the victim's network topology that can be used during targeting. Information about network
topologies may include a variety of details, including the physical and/or logical arrangement of both external-facing and internal network
environments. This information may also include speciﬁcs regarding network devices (gateways, routers, etc.) and other infrastructure.
Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via Active Scanning or Phishing for Information.
Information about network topologies may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: Search Victim-Owned
Websites). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Search Open Technical Databases
or Search Open Websites/Domains), establishing operational resources (ex: Acquire Infrastructure or Compromise Infrastructure), and/or
initial access (ex: External Remote Services).Other sub-techniques of Gather Victim Network Information (6)
