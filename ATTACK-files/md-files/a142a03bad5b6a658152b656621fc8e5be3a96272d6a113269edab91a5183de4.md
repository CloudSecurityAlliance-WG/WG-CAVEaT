Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1038 Execution
PreventionAdversaries install new AppCertDLL binaries to execute this technique. Identify and block potentially
malicious software executed through AppCertDLLs functionality by using application control tools, like
Windows Defender Application Control, AppLocker, or Software Restriction Policies where
appropriate. Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppCert DLLs loaded into
processes. Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are speciﬁed in the AppCertDLLs Registry key under
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\ are loaded into every process that calls the ubiquitously
used application programming interface (API) functions CreateProcess , CreateProcessAsUser , CreateProcessWithLoginW ,
CreateProcessWithTokenW , or WinExec . 
Similar to Process Injection, this value can be abused to obtain elevated privileges by causing a malicious DLL to be loaded and run in the
context of separate processes on the computer. Malicious AppCert DLLs may also provide persistence by continuously being triggered by
API activity.Other sub-techniques of Event Triggered Execution (16)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command Execution Monitor executed commands and arguments that may establish persistence
and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppCert
DLLs loaded into processes.
DS0011 Module Module Load Monitor DLL loads by processes, speciﬁcally looking for DLLs that are not
recognized or not normally loaded into a process. Tools such as Sysinternals
Autoruns may overlook AppCert DLLs as an auto-starting location. 
DS0009 Process OS API Execution Monitor and analyze application programming interface (API) calls that are
indicative of Registry edits, such as RegCreateKeyEx and RegSetValueEx . 
Process Creation Monitor newly executed processes that may establish persistence and/or elevate
privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppCert DLLs loaded into
processes.
DS0024 Windows RegistryWindows Registry
Key ModiﬁcationMonitor the AppCertDLLs Registry value for modiﬁcations that do not correlate
with known software, patch cycles, etc.
