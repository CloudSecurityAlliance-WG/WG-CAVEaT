Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1027 Password
PoliciesEnsure that AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption property is set to disabled unless there are
application requirements.
M1026 Privileged
Account
ManagementAudit domain and local accounts as well as their permission levels routinely to look for situations that
could allow an adversary to gain wide access by obtaining credentials of a privileged account. These
audits should also include if default accounts have been enabled, or if new local accounts are created
that have not be authorized. Follow best practices for design and administration of an enterprise network
to limit privileged account use across administrative tiers.An adversary may abuse Active Directory authentication encryption properties to gain access to credentials on Windows systems. The
AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption property speciﬁes whether reversible password encryption for an account is enabled or disabled. By
default this property is disabled (instead storing user credentials as the output of one-way hashing functions) and should not be enabled
unless legacy or other software require it.
If the property is enabled and/or a user changes their password after it is enabled, an adversary may be able to obtain the plaintext of
passwords created/changed after the property was enabled. To decrypt the passwords, an adversary needs four components:
1. Encrypted password (G$RADIUSCHAP ) from the Active Directory user-structure userParameters
2. 16 byte randomly-generated value (G$RADIUSCHAPKEY ) also from userParameters
3. Global LSA secret (G$MSRADIUSCHAPKEY )
4. Static key hardcoded in the Remote Access Subauthentication DLL (RASSFM.DLL )
With this information, an adversary may be able to reproduce the encryption key and subsequently decrypt the encrypted password value.
An adversary may set this property at various scopes through Local Group Policy Editor, user properties, Fine-Grained Password Policy
(FGPP), or via the ActiveDirectory PowerShell module. For example, an adversary may implement and apply a FGPP to users or groups if the
Domain Functional Level is set to "Windows Server 2008" or higher. In PowerShell, an adversary may make associated changes to user
settings using commands similar to Set-ADUser -AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption $true .Other sub-techniques of Modify Authentication Process (8)
