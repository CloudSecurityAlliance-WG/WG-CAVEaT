https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/001/ 3/5System Network Conﬁguration Discovery: Internet
Connection Discovery
Adversaries may check for Internet connectivity on compromised systems. This may be performed during automated discovery and can be
accomplished in numerous ways such as using Ping, tracert , and GET requests to websites.
Adversaries may use the results and responses from these requests to determine if the system is capable of communicating with their C2
servers before attempting to connect to them. The results may also be used to identify routes, redirectors, and proxy servers.Other sub-techniques of System Network Conﬁguration Discovery (2)

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/001/ 4/5Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0016 APT29 APT29 has ensured web servers in a victim environment are Internet accessible before copying tools or
malware to it.
S1066 DarkTortilla DarkTortilla can check for internet connectivity by issuing HTTP GET requests.
G1016 FIN13 FIN13 has used Ping and tracert for network reconnaissance efforts.
G0061 FIN8 FIN8 has used the Ping command to check connectivity to actor-controlled C2 servers.

GroupGamaredon Group has tested connectivity between a compromised machine and a C2 server using Ping
with commands such as CSIDL\_SYSTEM\cmd.exe /c ping -n 1 .
S0597 GoldFinder GoldFinder performed HTTP GET requests to check internet connectivity and identify HTTP proxy servers
and other redirectors that an HTTP request traveled through.
G0125 HAFNIUM HAFNIUM has checked for network connectivity from a compromised host using ping , including
attempts to contact google[.]com .
G1001 HEXANE HEXANE has used tools including BITSAdmin to test internet connectivity from compromised hosts.
G0059 Magic Hound Magic Hound has conducted a network call out to a speciﬁc website as part of their initial discovery
activity.

C0024 SolarWinds
CompromiseDuring the SolarWinds Compromise, APT29 used GoldFinder to perform HTTP GET requests to check
internet connectivity and identify HTTP proxy servers and other redirectors that an HTTP request travels
through.
S1049 SUGARUSH SUGARUSH has checked for internet connectivity from an infected host before attempting to establish a
new TCP connection.

G0010 Turla Turla has used tracert to check internet connectivity.
S1065 Woody RAT Woody RAT can make Ping GET HTTP requests to its C2 server at regular intervals for network
connectivity checks.
Mitigations
This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.[1]
