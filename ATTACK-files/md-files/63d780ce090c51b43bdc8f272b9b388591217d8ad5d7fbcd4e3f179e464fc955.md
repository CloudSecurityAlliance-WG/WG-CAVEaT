https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004/ 3/5Unsecured Credentials: Private Keys
Adversaries may search for private key certiﬁcate ﬁles on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. Private cryptographic keys
and certiﬁcates are used for authentication, encryption/decryption, and digital signatures. Common key and certiﬁcate ﬁle extensions
include: .key, .pgp, .gpg, .ppk., .p12, .pem, .pfx, .cer, .p7b, .asc.
Adversaries may also look in common key directories, such as ~/.ssh for SSH keys on \* nix-based systems or C:\Users\
(username)\.ssh\ on Windows. Adversary tools may also search compromised systems for ﬁle extensions relating to cryptographic keys
and certiﬁcates.
When a device is registered to Azure AD, a device key and a transport key are generated and used to verify the device’s identity. An
adversary with access to the device may be able to export the keys in order to impersonate the device.
On network devices, private keys may be exported via Network Device CLI commands such as crypto pki export .
Some private keys require a password or passphrase for operation, so an adversary may also use Input Capture for keylogging or attempt to
Brute Force the passphrase off-line. These private keys can be used to authenticate to Remote Services like SSH or for use in decrypting
other collected ﬁles such as email.Other sub-techniques of Unsecured Credentials (8)

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004/ 4/5Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0677 AADInternals AADInternals can gather encryption keys from Azure AD services such as ADSync and Active Directory
Federated Services servers.
S0377 Ebury Ebury has intercepted unencrypted private keys as well as private key pass-phrases.
S0363 Empire Empire can use modules like Invoke-SessionGopher to extract private key and session information.
S0661 FoggyWeb FoggyWeb can retrieve token signing certiﬁcates and token decryption certiﬁcates from a compromised
AD FS server.
S0601 Hildegard Hildegard has searched for private keys in .ssh.
S0283 jRAT jRAT can steal keys for VPNs and cryptocurrency wallets.
S0599 Kinsing Kinsing has searched for private keys.
S0409 Machete Machete has scanned and looked for cryptographic keys and certiﬁcate ﬁle extensions.
S1060 Mafalda Mafalda can collect a Chrome encryption key used to protect browser cookies.
S0002 Mimikatz Mimikatz's CRYPTO::Extract module can extract keys by interacting with Windows cryptographic
application programming interface (API) functions.
C0014 Operation Wocao During Operation Wocao, threat actors used Mimikatz to dump certiﬁcates and private keys from the
Windows certiﬁcate store.
G0106 Rocke Rocke has used SSH private keys on the infected machine to spread its coinminer throughout a network.
C0024 SolarWinds
CompromiseDuring the SolarWinds Compromise, APT29 obtained PKI keys, certiﬁcate ﬁles, and the private encryption
key from an Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) container to decrypt corresponding SAML
signing certiﬁcates.
G0139 TeamTNT TeamTNT has searched for unsecured SSH keys.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Ensure only authorized keys are allowed access to critical resources and audit access lists
regularly.
M1041 Encrypt Sensitive
InformationWhen possible, store keys on separate cryptographic hardware instead of on the local system. For
example, on Windows systems use a TPM to secure keys and other sensitive credential material.
M1027 Password Policies Use strong passphrases for private keys to make cracking diﬃcult.
M1022 Restrict File and
Directory PermissionsEnsure permissions are properly set on folders containing sensitive private keys to prevent
unintended access. Additionally, on Cisco devices, set the nonexportable ﬂag during RSA key
pair generation.[7]
