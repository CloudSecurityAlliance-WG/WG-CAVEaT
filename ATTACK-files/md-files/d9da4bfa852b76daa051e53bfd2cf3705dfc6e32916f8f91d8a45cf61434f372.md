Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0661 FoggyWeb FoggyWeb can allow abuse of a compromised AD FS server's SAML token.
C0024 SolarWinds
CompromiseDuring the SolarWinds Compromise, APT29 used forged SAML tokens that allowed the actors to
impersonate users and bypass MFA, enabling APT29 to access enterprise cloud applications and
services.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementLimit credential overlap across systems to prevent the damage of credential compromise and
reduce the adversary's ability to perform Lateral Movement between systems.
M1018 User Account
ManagementEnforce the principle of least-privilege. Do not allow a domain user to be in the local administrator
group on multiple systems.Adversaries may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to
move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.
Authentication processes generally require a valid identity (e.g., username) along with one or more authentication factors (e.g., password,
pin, physical smart card, token generator, etc.). Alternate authentication material is legitimately generated by systems after a user or
application successfully authenticates by providing a valid identity and the required authentication factor(s). Alternate authentication
material may also be generated during the identity creation process.
Caching alternate authentication material allows the system to verify an identity has successfully authenticated without asking the user to
reenter authentication factor(s). Because the alternate authentication must be maintained by the system—either in memory or on disk—it
may be at risk of being stolen through Credential Access techniques. By stealing alternate authentication material, adversaries are able to
bypass system access controls and authenticate to systems without knowing the plaintext password or any additional authentication
factors.Sub-techniques (4)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0026 Active Directory Active Directory
Credential
RequestMonitor requests of new ticket granting ticket or service tickets to a Domain Controller,
such as Windows EID 4769 or 4768, that may use alternate authentication material,
such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to
move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentMonitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may
use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and
application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and
bypass normal system access controls.
DS0028 Logon Session Logon Session
CreationLook for suspicious account behavior across systems that share accounts, either user,
admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple systems
simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously;
accounts logged in at odd times or outside of business hours. Activity may be from
interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute
binaries on a remote system as a particular account.
DS0002 User Account User Account
AuthenticationMonitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource,
often by providing credentials that may use alternate authentication material, such as
password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move
laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.
DS0006 Web Credential Web Credential
UsageMonitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource by
providing web credentials (ex: Windows EID 1202) that may use alternate
authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application
access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal
system access controls.
