Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0484 Carberp Carberp can start a remote VNC session by downloading a new plugin.
S1014 DanBot DanBot can use VNC for remote access to targeted systems.
G0046 FIN7 FIN7 has used TightVNC to control compromised hosts.
G0117 Fox Kitten Fox Kitten has installed TightVNC server and client on compromised servers and endpoints for lateral
movement.
G0047 Gamaredon
GroupGamaredon Group has used VNC tools, including UltraVNC, to remotely interact with compromised hosts.
G0036 GCMAN GCMAN uses VNC for lateral movement.
S0279 Proton Proton uses VNC to connect into systems.
S0266 TrickBot TrickBot has used a VNC module to monitor the victim and collect information to pivot to valuable
systems on the network 
S0670 WarzoneRAT WarzoneRAT has the ability of performing remote desktop access via a VNC console.
S0412 ZxShell ZxShell supports functionality for VNC sessions.Adversaries may use Valid Accounts to remotely control machines using Virtual Network Computing (VNC). VNC is a platform-independent
desktop sharing system that uses the RFB ("remote framebuffer") protocol to enable users to remotely control another computer’s display by
relaying the screen, mouse, and keyboard inputs over the network.
VNC differs from Remote Desktop Protocol as VNC is screen-sharing software rather than resource-sharing software. By default, VNC uses
the system's authentication, but it can be conﬁgured to use credentials speciﬁc to VNC.
Adversaries may abuse VNC to perform malicious actions as the logged-on user such as opening documents, downloading ﬁles, and running
arbitrary commands. An adversary could use VNC to remotely control and monitor a system to collect data and information to pivot to other
systems within the network. Speciﬁc VNC libraries/implementations have also been susceptible to brute force attacks and memory usage
exploitation.Other sub-techniques of Remote Services (8)

ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Inventory workstations for unauthorized VNC server software.
M1042 Disable or Remove
Feature or ProgramUninstall any VNC server software where not required.
M1037 Filter Network Traﬃc VNC defaults to TCP ports 5900 for the server, 5800 for browser access, and 5500 for a viewer in
listening mode. Filtering or blocking these ports will inhibit VNC traﬃc utilizing default ports.
M1033 Limit Software
InstallationRestrict software installation to user groups that require it. A VNC server must be manually
installed by the user or adversary.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0028 Logon Session Logon Session
CreationMonitor for user accounts logged into systems that may use Valid Accounts to
remotely control machines using Virtual Network Computing (VNC). For example, on
macOS systems log show --predicate 'process = "screensharingd" and
eventMessage contains "Authentication:"' can be used to review incoming VNC
connection attempts for suspicious activity.
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork
Connection
CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that may use Valid Accounts to
remotely control machines using Virtual Network Computing (VNC). Use of VNC may be
legitimate depending on the environment and how it’s used. Other factors, such as
access patterns and activity that occurs after a remote login, may indicate suspicious
or malicious behavior using VNC.
DS0009 Process Process Creation Monitor for newly executed processes that may use Valid Accounts to remotely control
machines using Virtual Network Computing (VNC). For example, on macOS systems
the screensharingd process may be related to VNC connection activity.[23]
