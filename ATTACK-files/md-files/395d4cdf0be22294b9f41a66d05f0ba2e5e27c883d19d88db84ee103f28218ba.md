Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount
and sensitivity of data available to external parties.
Detection
Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the
visibility of the target organization, making detection diﬃcult for defenders.
Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.Adversaries may gather information about identities and roles within the victim organization that can be used during targeting. Information
about business roles may reveal a variety of targetable details, including identiﬁable information for key personnel as well as what
data/resources they have access to.
Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via Phishing for Information. Information about business
roles may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: Social Media or Search Victim-Owned Websites).
Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Phishing for Information or Search Open
Websites/Domains), establishing operational resources (ex: Establish Accounts or Compromise Accounts), and/or initial access (ex:
Phishing).Other sub-techniques of Gather Victim Org Information (4)
