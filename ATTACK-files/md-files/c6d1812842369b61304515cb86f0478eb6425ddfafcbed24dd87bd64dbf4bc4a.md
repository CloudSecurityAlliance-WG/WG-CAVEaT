DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentMonitor call logs from corporate devices to identify patterns of potential voice
phishing, such as calls to/from known malicious phone numbers.Adversaries may use voice communications to elicit sensitive information that can be used during targeting. Spearphishing for information
is an attempt to trick targets into divulging information, frequently credentials or other actionable information. Spearphishing for information
frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a source with a reason to collect information (ex: Impersonation)
and/or creating a sense of urgency or alarm for the recipient.
All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. In this scenario, adversaries use phone calls to elicit sensitive
information from victims. Known as voice phishing (or "vishing"), these communications can be manually executed by adversaries, hired call
centers, or even automated via robocalls. Voice phishers may spoof their phone number while also posing as a trusted entity, such as a
business partner or technical support staff.
Victims may also receive phishing messages that direct them to call a phone number ("callback phishing") where the adversary attempts to
collect conﬁdential information.
Adversaries may also use information from previous reconnaissance efforts (ex: Search Open Websites/Domains or Search Victim-Owned
Websites) to tailor pretexts to be even more persuasive and believable for the victim.Other sub-techniques of Phishing for Information (4)
